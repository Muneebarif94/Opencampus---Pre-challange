  <p> I have done my bachelor’s degree in Computer & Information Systems Engineering from NED University, Pakistan in 2017. During my studies I have also done couple of trainings i.e. I worked as a Research Assistant as “High performance computing centre” and NET University Karachi. <br> <br>

  The area of my research was “Software as a service” over the Cloud and I gave my part in developing Cloud based Firewall. Also, another opportunity that I got to learn in the field of Network Security was at United Bank Limited, Pakistan. <br>
	
	<br /> Currently, I am a computer scientist research student at CAU Kiel and appearing in 2nd semester. I enjoy being challenged and working on projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new technologies in IT field.</p>
